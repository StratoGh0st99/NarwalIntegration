# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-01)

**Core value:** Users can control and monitor their Narwal Flow vacuum entirely locally — start/stop/pause, see status, view a live floor map — without any cloud dependency.
**Current focus:** Phase 12 Plan 01 COMPLETE — camera snapshot, LED control, burst service

## Current Position

Phase: 12 of 12 — IN PROGRESS (Camera & Patrol)
Plan: 01 of ? — Complete (Camera snapshot + LED building blocks)
Last activity: 2026-03-16 — Take Photo button, Camera Light switch, NarwalSnapshotCamera, narwal.take_snapshot service

Progress: [█████████░] 92% (11/12 plans done)

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (Phase 8)

- Entity availability uses coordinator.last_update_success, not client.connected
- 5 consecutive poll failures before marking unavailable (~5 min grace period)
- Removed client.connect() from poll loop to avoid racing with listener
- Mock HA framework via sys.modules stubs (ha_stubs.py) instead of pytest-homeassistant-custom-component
- Test config flow with __new__ + mocked base methods for isolated async_step_user testing

### Key Decisions (Phase 7)

- Coordinate transform: factor 1.0, pixel = raw - origin (no scaling)
- is_returning requires BOTH field 3.7 AND 3.10 (prevents false positives)
- Room data is 100% local — ROOM_TYPE enum + instance_index for names
- Furniture obstacles are LOCAL (field 2.32, typeId = APK furniture enum). Vision obstacles likely also local — needs probing during active clean.
- Trail segment breaks are obstacle avoidance, not a rendering bug (deferred)
- Label overlap matches Narwal app behavior (not an issue to fix)

### Key Decisions (Phase 9)

- Room IDs encoded as repeated varint in field 1.2 of CleanTask protobuf
- Segment.group uses Rooms/Utility based on RoomInfo.category
- Empty room_ids in start_rooms() falls back to whole-house clean
- Bare roomId in field 1.2 is IGNORED by robot; each room entry needs full MapCleanParamInfo fields (cleanMode=2, cleanTimes=1, sweepMode=3, mopMode=2)
- Room-clean response returns code=0 with config data (not usual code=1 ack)

### Pending Todos

- "Self test paused" unmapped working_status
- CleanTask payload hardcodes max suction / wet mop / single pass
- Validate: does start work WITHOUT CleanTask payload?

### Key Decisions (Phase 10)

- Obstacle positions are LOCAL (field 2.32), not cloud-only — corrects Phase 7 assumption
- typeId IS the specific furniture enum from APK map_furniture.json (NOT category codes — corrected after user validation)
- Pass obstacles + origin to render_base_map (not pre-computed grid coords)
- Obstacles render on base map (static, cached) not overlay
- Skip rotation for v1 — axis-aligned rectangles sufficient

### Key Decisions (Phase 11)

- Vision obstacle data source: display_map field 9 (confirmed by probe in plan 11-01)
- detection_seq (field 2) used as dedup ID — robot provides unique incrementing counter
- VisionObstacleInfo is a separate dataclass from ObstacleInfo — different lifecycle and data source
- render_overlay extended with backward-compatible vision_obstacles + origin_x/origin_y params (default None/0)
- Vision obstacles cleared in _reset_trail() — same lifecycle hook as trail (fires on new cleaning session)
- Field 9 has type_id + detection_seq but NOT coordinates — field 12 coordinate parsing deferred

### Key Decisions (Phase 12, Plan 01)

- Snapshot camera is_streaming=False — privacy-first, only fires on explicit button press or service call
- AES-encrypted images stored as raw bytes until APK decryption key extracted — NarwalSnapshotCamera will not display correctly until future plan
- HA test stubs for ButtonEntity/SwitchEntity/Camera use plain class stubs (not MagicMock) to avoid __setattr__ MRO conflicts when entities are instantiated in tests
- Service registered idempotently via has_service guard in async_setup_entry
